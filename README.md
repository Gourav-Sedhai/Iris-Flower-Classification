# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris Flowers Classification Project.

About:
-----
The iris flowers have different species and we can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals. This data set consists of the physical parameters of three species of flower — Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica. The numeric parameters which the dataset contains are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width and Petal length. This is a basic project to predict the species of a new iris flower.

So I built a model to predict the the species of a new iris flower and I used following algorithms to compare on the process of training the model:
1. K – Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Randomforest
4. Logistic Regression
